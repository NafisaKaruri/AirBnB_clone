# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

After creating the interpreter with LinaAbdelkhalig, now I worked on this part of the project on building the front end step-by-step ("design" - "sketck" - "prototype").

The web is totally static containing:
- Simple HTML static pages
- Styles
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

During this project, I learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS.

## Directories:
- `images`: all the images are saved there
- `styles`: all the CSS files are saved there

At the root of this directory is a python file `w3c-validator` to check if the code is W3C compliant and valid.
